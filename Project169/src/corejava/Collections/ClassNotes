Collection : Root interface with basic methods like add(), remove(), 
             contains(), isEmpty(), addAll(), ... etc.
 
Set : Doesn't allow duplicates and elements are not-order. 
List : Can contain duplicates and elements are ordered. 
Map : Contains Key value pairs. Doesn't allow duplicates.  
     
The difference between Set and Map interface is that in Set we 
have only keys, whereas in Map, we have key, value pairs.
